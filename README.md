# web-scrapping-script
Quick web-scrapping script using both Selenium webDriver and BeautifulSoup4.


Needed a list of names from a dropdown menu, it had 170 items but only 12 were visible at any given time.

And to view the other items you needed to scroll since they're only loaded with JS.

The form was only up for a limited time and I had to come up with any solution so it didn't matter to have the best one.

**Note:** The path to chromedriver.exe and the form link are removed to avoid any data privacy issues.
